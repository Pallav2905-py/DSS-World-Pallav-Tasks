# MCU Tamper and Infant Detection

This project simulates a microcontroller (MCU) system to detect tampering and identify infants based on sensor data (height, weight, and movement).

## Features
- **Tamper Detection**: Identifies significant changes in sensor data indicating potential tampering.
- **Infant Identification**: Detects infants based on thresholds for height, weight, and movement.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MCU_Tamper_Infant_Detection.git
    cd MCU_Tamper_Infant_Detection
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Run the main script to simulate data collection and processing:
```bash
python main.py
