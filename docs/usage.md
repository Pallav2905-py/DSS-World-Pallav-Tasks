# Usage Guide

## Running the Simulation

1. Ensure you have installed all required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the main script to start the simulation:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The script will collect sensor data, simulate stop events, and detect tampering and identify infants.

## Log Files

Logs are saved in the `logs/` directory. Review `mcu_device.log` for detailed logs of the simulation.

## Configuration

You can adjust the storage capacity, thresholds, and number of data points in the main script and individual module files.
